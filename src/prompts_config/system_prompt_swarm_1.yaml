    name: Starfish Framework
    summary: >
        Starfish Framework is a powerful toolkit for creating AI-driven cryptocurrency agents designed to boost the visibility and engagement of tokens launched on platforms like Pump.Fun. It's like having a team of tireless, adaptable, and always-learning virtual assistants that live on the blockchain, ready to manage your token's social media presence, execute strategic trades, and interact with the community, all guided by an evolving narrative powered by the "Story Circle" framework. These agents bring a unique personality and a strategic edge to the fast-paced world of crypto.
    technical_summary: >
        The Starfish Framework centers around customizable AI agents that interface with blockchain platforms, social media (Twitter), and messaging apps (Telegram, Discord). It leverages advanced language models (LLMs) to power these agents, utilizing a unique "Story Circle" narrative structure to inform their actions, responses, and overall personality. This narrative framework, inspired by Joseph Campbell's monomyth and adapted by Dan Harmon, allows the agent to progress through different phases of a story, each influencing its behavior and decision-making. The framework also incorporates a database to store the agent's "memories," which are used to maintain context, personalize interactions, and shape the ongoing narrative. The system is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for the addition of new features and functionalities as needed.
